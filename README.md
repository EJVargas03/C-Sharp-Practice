# C-Sharp-Practice
This repository is just a refresher on C#

[For future reference or if someone so happens to stumble across this repository 
I will link the resources I used to learn/refresh myself about C#]

This is the course I am currently following
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/foundational-c-sharp-with-microsoft/
[Each module will have a link to its own lab]
